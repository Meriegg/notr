# Why?

I made this project to help me manage text files on my computer. I am planning to make a chrome extension allowing you to connect your browser to notr so that if you have any saved passwords in notr you can search for them in the top right corner of your browser and autofill anything.

# How can you use it?

To avoid privacy headaches you can clone this repository and self host your own version!

I personally host this on vercel (for the website) and supabase (only for the postgres database, 500mb should be enough storage for most people).

Feel free to host this anywhere!

# Enjoy!
