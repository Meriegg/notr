# Why?

I made this project to help me manage text files on my computer.

# How can you use it?

To avoid privacy headaches you can clone this repository and self host your own version!

I personally host this on vercel (for the website) and supabase (only for the postgres database, 500mb should be enough storage for most people).

Feel free to host this anywhere!

# Enjoy!
